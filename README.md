# Worst Implementation Competition
An implementation of PayrollProgram that seeks to break as many rules as possible from the codedesign book. 
This implementation is a joke and for class competition purposes only. 

## Rules Broken:
* No documentation/comments: This makes it hard for new developers to make contributions, as they are not familiar with the code. 
* Bad code structure: Makes it hard to understand the code and makes room for potential bugs to be overlooked.
* Bad variable names: This makes it difficult to read the implementation, but also makes it difficult to track what data is stored and introduces space for errors.
* Use of parallel arrays as global variables to track data: This is not efficient and introduces poor scalability, may introduce issues that are not easy to track, and cannot be easily reused if the data changes.
* No whitespace (PAYROLLOPTIMAL): Makes it extremely difficult to read and understand.
